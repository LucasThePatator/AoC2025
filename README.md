## Day 1

I struggled with this one. It wasn't fun to just fight the python operators...

## Day 2

Pretty straightforward. Divisibility helps with pruning cases for star two.

## Day 3    

Eh, boring. Just a bit of math considerations

## Day 4

Straightforward, thinking not required. Classic convolution

## Day 5

First one with a tiny bit of thinking to do. Merging ranges is fun.

## Day 6

Fully an issue of parsing. Meh

## Day 7

Struggled a bit more than was reasonable. Still pretty easy
